This is a repository for storing all utilities that I build (to automation and beyond). I mostly use 'python' and 'bash' for such stuff.

RosterOperations
================
Has all utility operations one might do with a class roster sheet.

grouping.py
-----------
- input : rooster file name (can have names/roll/name&roll number in each line), group size
- output : Group list
